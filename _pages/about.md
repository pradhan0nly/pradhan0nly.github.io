I am a graduate student in the Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Virginia Tech under the supervision of Dr. Harpreet S. Dhillon. I finished my bachelor's degree at the top of my class in Electrical and Communication Engineering from the National Institute of Technology, Durgapur, India in 2018. In my undergraduate career, I represented India in Japan in JENESYS 2016 programme with other SAARC countries under the theme 'Telecommunication' organized by the Japan International Cooperation Center (JICE) and Ministry of Foreign Affairs of both countries. I have also interned at IISc Bangalore in my junior year. After my bachelor's, I worked as a research intern at the Wirocomm lab, IIIT Delhi in the area of theoretical massive MIMO. My research interests are currently in the area of MIMO, optimization theory, and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces.
