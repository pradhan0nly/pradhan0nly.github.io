I am a PhD candidate in the Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Virginia Tech, under the supervision of <a href='https://www.dhillon.ece.vt.edu/'>Dr. Harpreet S. Dhillon</a>. I am graduating in May 2025 and am actively looking for opportunities to collaborate and contribute to cutting-edge research and development.

I completed my bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from the National Institute of Technology, Durgapur, India, in 2018, graduating as the top student in my class.

My research focuses on wireless communications, with specific interests in MIMO systems, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces, optimization theory, phased antenna arrays, beam management, and channel modeling. I am passionate about leveraging these areas to address fundamental challenges in modern wireless systems and developing innovative solutions to improve communication efficiency and reliability.

I have published my work in reputable venues such as IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications (TWC) and Nature Scientific Reports, reflecting my commitment to high-quality research and impactful contributions to the field. Most recently, I worked as a Wireless System Engineering Intern at NXP Semiconductors, where I designed reference codebooks for mmWave systems, integrated beam-training protocols into system-level simulators, and collaborated with the RF team to conduct throughput tests on a mmWave testbed.
