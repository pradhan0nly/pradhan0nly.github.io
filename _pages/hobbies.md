### Hobbies and Activities

Other than my research activities, some of my hobbies (activities I want to spend more time in but do not get the time) are:

- **Martial arts**: I trained in Taekwondo during college, inspired by Power Rangers. Yes, I have been kicked in the head. I have also tried some parkour out when I was in San Jose for three months.

- **Cooking**: Iâ€™m an avid home cook inspired by **[Sorted Food](https://www.youtube.com/user/sortedfood)** and **[Bong Eats](https://www.youtube.com/@BongEats)**. My latest achievement was cooking **Beef Rendang** and saving our kitchen from burning down the apartment.

- **Video Games**: I grew up with video games and have played almost all the FIFA games in the series. Some other favorites include Apex Legends, Valorant, Assassin's Creed, Cities: Skylines, and Cyberpunk 2077.  

- **Bored Coding**: Sometimes, I code small quality-of-life improvement scripts. For example, I wrote a **Wordle solver** in MATLAB (not in frustration, obviously!) and am currently repurposing an old phone as an occupancy sensor and door knock detector because with headphones on, I sometimes miss people in the living room or the sound of delivery knocks.

Feel free to reach out if any of these resonate with you!
